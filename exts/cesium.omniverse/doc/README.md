# Cesium for Omniverse

Cesium for Omniverse enables building 3D geospatial applications and experiences with 3D Tiles and open standards in NVIDIA Omniverse, a real-time 3D graphics collaboration development platform. Cesium for Omniverse is an extension for Omniverse's Kit-based applications such as USD Composer (formerly Create), a reference application for large-scale world building and advanced 3D scene composition of Universal Scene Description (USD)-based workflows, and Omniverse Code, an integrated development environment (IDE) for developers. Cesium for Omniverse enables developers to create geospatial and enterprise metaverse, simulations, digital twins, and other real-world applications in precise geospatial context and stream massive real-word 3D content.

By combining a high-accuracy full-scale WGS84 globe, open APIs and open standards for spatial indexing such as 3D Tiles, and cloud-based real-world content from Cesium ion with Omniverse, this extension enables rich 3D geospatial workflows and applications in Omniverse, which adds real-time ray tracing and AI-powered analytics.

### Cesium for Omniverse and the 3D Geospatial Ecosystem

Cesium for Omniverse streams real-world 3D content such as high-resolution photogrammetry, terrain, imagery, and 3D buildings from Cesium ion and other sources, available as optional commercial subscriptions. The extension includes Cesium ion integration for instant access to global high-resolution 3D content ready for runtime streaming. Cesium ion users can also leverage cloud-based 3D tiling pipelines to create end-to-end workflows to transform massive heterogenous content into semantically-rich 3D Tiles, ready for streaming to Omniverse.

Cesium for Omniverse supports cloud and private network content and services based on open standards and APIs. You are free to use any combination of supported content sources, standards, APIs with Cesium for Omniverse.

Using Cesium ion helps support Cesium for Omniverse development.
